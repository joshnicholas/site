This site is pretty new. It is mostly an experiment and very much a work in progress. Sorry if anything breaks.</p><br> <p>For almost 20 years this domain hosted a much neglected blog. The book reviews I posted in high school were truly terrible. In 2019 I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/15/i-used-to-think-art-required-natural-talent-then-i-taught-myself-to-draw">started to take drawing a bit more seriously</a> and posting scribbles semi-regularly.</p><br> <p>Over time I amassed a couple hundred scribbles on here, but most of them were stuck behind a chronological timeline. I also lost hundreds more through various platform migrations.</p><br> <p>I recently decided to try something new. This is both an archive of (whats left of) earlier scribbles, and a growing collection of newer stuff posted on social media. I'm putting the emphasis on discovery rather than chronology. I've scheduled a script to update about once a week.</p><br></div></div> <div class="clear-left"></div></div>`);function c(e){var a=i();t(e,a)}export{c as component,d as universal};
